I've been working on improving a feature that has a couple large bugs around it.
After adding some functionality, the bugs seem to scream a little more than
before, and I'm not quite at the point where I can start working on a fix 
for them.

So now I'm faced with a situation where I have a new feature, but it can't be
released until the other bugs are resolved. What can we do in this sort of 
situation?

Well, one option would just be to *hide* the buggy part of the code. If the user
can't interact with it, then the bugs can't *bug* anyone from the user's point of 
view! However, if the feature is hidden, then we kinda lose out on an entire
feature. So I suppose this would be a decision to bring to the customer to
weigh out the pros and cons of doing this.

In any case, the option is there to hide the buggy code from the view until it's
ready to be released.
