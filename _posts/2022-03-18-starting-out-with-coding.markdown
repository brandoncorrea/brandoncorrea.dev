Today, a friend of mine asked me what it takes to become a
programmer. In an [earlier post][anyone-can-code], I talk about 
some characteristics of a good programmer. This basically amounted
to someone who has the desire to code and the will to learn. 
Very basic, yet very important. 

So now I'm looking for ways to get my friend started. Books, online
courses, anything I can find to get him started with programming.
Then I thought back to my first taste of Clojure–the 
[Clojure Koans][clojure-koans]!

This is a fun and excellent way to start learning Clojure, and really 
programming in general. It starts you out with some basic data type 
operations and takes you all the way through Clojure's more complex 
functions.

But there are more Koan options than just Clojure:
- [C](https://github.com/c-koans/c_koans)
- [C#](https://github.com/NotMyself/DotNetCoreKoans)
- [Python](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans)
- ... and so many more!

Now, I wouldn't recommend starting with C as a first language. There's a
lot that needs to be done manually in C that just isn't an issue in most 
languages today. However, I think it's a language that every programmer 
should at least play around in once or twice at some point.

I started with Python and became an addict upon executing my first 
`Hello, World!` program. But you can really start with any language!
Clojure, Ruby, Java... whatever you think would be the most fun!

Whatever language you decide on, the first place I would start is going
through Koans for that language.
