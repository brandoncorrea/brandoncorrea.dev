I've been working on implementing some web designs that a coworker had 
created. What's really nice though is how these designs are set up.
I'm given _only_ the HTML/CSS for the component, and I can just add 
functionality to it.

So a typical file might look something like this (usually with more content):

````clojure
(ns foo.sandbox.title)

(defn render []
  [:div.class1.class2
   [:div.container.centered
    [:h1.centered.large.title "Lorem ipsum dolor"]]])
````

This makes things so much easier since all I need to do is sort of fill in 
the blanks! So if I were to implement the component above, it would look 
something like this.

````clojure
(defn show-title [title]
  [:div.class1.class2
   [:div.container.centered 
    [:h1.centered.large.title title]]])
````

What makes this even better is that these are all routed to sandbox pages
that I can view in the browser! So when I need some guidance on how the 
component should look, I can go to the sandbox page where the component 
lives and behold it in all its glory.

This sort of structure might be common among development teamsâ€“I wouldn't
know. Maybe this structure is something you can try in your projects!
