Hello! My name is Brandon Correa and this is my blog site. A
few things I really enjoy are math, coding and playing music. 
When I have free time, it is usually spent doing one of those two things.

I've recently started exploring different topics like chemistry, hacking, 
and a little bit of poetry. It'd be cool to get into Raspberry PI and robotics
stuff, but I have no idea where I'd even start with that. 

I'm hoping that one day I'll be able to just run around in a lab coat doing 
crazy sciencey things (like Emmett Brown) and people will just think it's normal.

I don't really have anything else to say... so uh, yeah. Enjoy my website!
