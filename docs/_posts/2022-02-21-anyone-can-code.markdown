Programming is something that anyone can learn! Whether you're eight 
or eighty-eight years old, if you have the desire to write code and the
willingness to learn, that is all you need to become a great software 
developer.

I was once asked in a programming interview, *"What makes a team member hard 
to work with?"* My first response was *"When they don't do their job well..."*
But then I caught myself, *"...**wait**..."* I had to really think about this–a 
bad team member isn't someone who performs poorly. A poor performer can be 
corrected, if they are willing. Thus, my amended response to this interview 
question is *"When they are **unwilling** to learn."*

Equipped only with a desire to code and a will to learn, you can become the
best software developer out there. Why is this so?

A desire to code ranges from person to person. Maybe it's just something you
think it's cool–like magic! For me, I love solving puzzles, automating 
tedious tasks, and [experimenting][experimentation] with things–seeing 
*"What would happen if...?"* 

Because you have a desire to code, you will code in your free time and 
discover new things! You will learn new languages, technologies, and many 
other domains of software. You will become a versatile asset–not somebody 
who knows only about the technologies the company is currently using.

Now maybe you have the desire to code, and you're even one of the best there
is! You've competed in coding tournaments, written books, given talks, 
even have two PhDs in Computer Science–but are you willing to learn?

    "There is always something more to learn, even for a master."
    - Master Shifu

If someone proposed a new solution, completely different from how you'd 
normally solve a problem, would you strike it down simply because you 
think you know better? Someone with this mindset cannot learn to 
code–anything you throw at them will simply bounce back and will not be 
retained.

On the other hand, someone who dropped out of elementary school and never 
does anything right, but is willing to learn, can become an excellent 
developer over time. Everything you throw at them will be absorbed–they
will retain this information and apply it next time they encounter that
problem. This person is preferable to someone who is unwilling to learn.

    "You are the master of your destiny: No one and nothing 
    can come in between you and your destiny except you. 
    Take destiny by the horns and have fun."
    - Po
