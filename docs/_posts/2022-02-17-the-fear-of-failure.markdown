The fear of failure one of the biggest obstacles that often prevents
us from achieving great things. It can cause us to overthink to 
the point where we don't move forward with the better of two options.

### Being Content

Before joining Clean Coders as an apprentice, I was working as a 
"programmer" at a grocery store. The work environment and the people
were great–but not many people had much enthusiasm or pride in their 
work. The typical mindset was to work your 8-5 and forget about work 
as soon as you leave the office.

This sort of mindset is probably the norm for most corporate employees,
but it often produced less than ideal resulted. There was ***so*** much 
more potential among my peers, but few had the enthusiasm to go the
extra mile–maybe because they had been there long enough to stop caring.

In any case, I was content with where I was and knew I had a secure
future if I stayed. Although, the fear that I might lose my enthusiasm
for work occasionally popped into my mind. Would I just become another 
corporate drone to code whatever business area wants?

### An Opportunity

Some time later, I had the opportunity to become an apprentice among
people who I would consider legends in the industry. The chance to
just meet some of them and ask a few questions was a privilege all 
on its own–never would I have thought I'd get to work with them.

The best way I could explain this opportunity to others is by comparing
it to [Bruce Wayne's][bruce-wayne] apprenticeship under 
[Ra's al Ghul][ras-al-ghul]–except Clean 
Coders isn't evil... and I'm not a billionaire :(

But my fear of failure ensued–*What if I don't make the cut?
What if I lose the security I had before?*

### A Decision

So now a decision has to be made: Should I leave my security and
stability behind to pursue this apprenticeship? Everything circles 
back to the bigger questions: *Why do I do what I do?* Well, I code 
because I genuinely find it fun, and it is something I can only hope
to master one day. 

So then what matters to me more? Risking everything I have for a chance
to learn from the best, and potentially even failing there. Or staying 
where I'm at where I can probably become a pretty good developer–but
probably not the best.

### You've Never Truly Failed

Albert Einstein is [credited][never-fail] for saying,
_You never fail until you stop trying._ If I had decided against the
apprenticeship, then I would have already failed at that decision.

Now even if I wind up failing today, the decision to attempt and fail 
is far better than not having tried at all–and even then I haven't 
truly failed unless I stopped trying.

All that to say, don't let a fear of failure get in the way of 
achieving great things.
