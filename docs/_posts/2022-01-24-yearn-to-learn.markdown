As developers, we are always told things like _never stop learning_ or
_always have a side project_. The biggest reasoning for this is because the tech
industry is constantly changing and, in order to remain attractive to employers, 
we should know all about the latest technologies.

But what if you're not particularly interested in keeping your portfolio up to date?
Maybe you're in a stable job, or maybe you understand that _somebody_ will always
need a developer, no matter how (ir)relevant their skill-set is. Why bother spending
your time learning something new when you don't _need_ to?

### Artists Find Joy in Art

A pianist will play their instrument for their upcoming performance, practicing
their music throughout the week. In his free time, he enjoys singing and playing 
the guitar. While he may not be good at either, he spends his time with this 
because he loves music.

By the same token, developers never stop learning because we never _want_ to stop
learning. We spend our time with side projects because we enjoy the tinkering process 
and the thrill of finally getting something to work.

How _does_ Git work anyways? How can I create my own C++ compiler? Will I ever create 
my own version control system or compiler? Probably not, but I want answers!

### Just Learn _Something_... Anything!

There are literally thousands of topics you could start learning about, so where
do you start? Well, just find something (anything) that interests you! I personally find
the idea of hacking fascinating, so I like to study it in my free time. But maybe you 
are more interested in databases, encryption, or the history of computing.

You could even explore topics in math, the natural sciences, or even philosophy. 
How can differential equations be used in performance optimizations? If the entirety of 
the known universe is composed of only 118 elements, then how can we apply this knowledge
to the development of software?

Write about things that worked and things that _didn't_ work. 
Build a system structured like an ant society and talk about it!
