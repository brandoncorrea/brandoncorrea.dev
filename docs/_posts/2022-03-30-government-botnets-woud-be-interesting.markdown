Over the past couple of decades, the digital world has started
to become a bigger battlefield than many of us would have thought
it would become.

### Your Typical Thief

My friend's Instagram account was acquired today by a scammer 
trying to steal money from their followers. This sort of hacker 
(though non-violent) can be equated to someone robbing a convenience
store or pedestrian. Their primary motivation is money.

### Weaponized Virus

You may be familiar with Stuxnet, which was designed to attack Iranian
nuclear power plants. This virus ended up spreading to other machines around
the world and was probably one of the first pieces of software to be weaponized
and used in an act of war.

### An "IT Army"

In a more recent development, the Ukraine government had called for an 
"IT Army" early on in the war to do whatever they can to disrupt Russia,
mostly targeting economic and government websites. This army totals 
around 300,000 people from around the world. Not a single person
and not a weapon this time–an army.

### Botnets

These things got me thinking about some other potential attacks someone 
could unleash. The idea of a botnet always seemed interesting–having 
hundreds or even thousands of machines sitting idly, waiting for orders
from a command server. 

The sheer number of machines available could be defined as a weapon–just
provide a target, and you could take it offline in minutes with a ping of death.
Now, this is essentially what Ukraine's army of 300,000 hackers is doing with
Russia's infrastructure, except these are all (mostly) physically controlled 
machines that are taking websites offline.

Now imagine if a government had a botnet consisting of the entire populations 
computers and smartphones. For Ukraine, this would be around 43 million devices.
For the US, about 332 million. Of course, not everybody will have a smartphone 
or computer, but I would imagine this number would be at least one third of the
population.

If a government had this sort of control over the population's devices, it would
be almost like a nuclear bomb of the internet. Everybody would know who launched 
the attack, and if the target had the same capabilities, retaliation of the same
sort would be expected.

Of course, this would only disrupt service for a time and flood some databases.
This sort of capability wouldn't be very effective in espionage or spreading
viruses to closed networks.
