I just finished making my first [ClojureScript][clojurescript] project by 
creating a new [UI for Tic Tac Toe][ttt-cljs]! Here I used [Reagent][reagent], 
which is a sort of bridge between React and Clojure.

Of course, being new to ClojureScript, I ended up running into a few problems.
I had found several ways of compiling ClojureScript to JavaScript, but I 
couldn't find any way to run tests while also using Reagent codeâ€“none of my
Google search solutions seemed to work.

Luckily, a coworker of mine has this awesome 
[ClojureScript sample project][cljs-sample-project] that stubs out all the 
main components needed to get ClojureScript tests up and running! 
Unfortunately though, I still had some trouble adding this to my existing 
Tic Tac Toe project. There were certain libraries that other interfaces depended
on that ClojureScript just did not like.

This was a good opportunity for me to learn how to publish a public library.
I ended up pulling out my core game logic into a new [ttt-core][ttt-core] 
project and publishing it to [Clojars][clojars]. After that, I was able to replace the 
original project's game logic with that library as well as import it into 
a fresh ClojureScript project!

Finally, I was ready to start writing ClojureScript. The terminal prompt 
was blinking and the test output was red... a wonderful sight indeed.
