It can be easy to get carried away with implementing a feature. In our minds,
we know exactly how it should work. We know what pieces go where, how it should
look and how it should behave... or at least we think we do.

Okay, so maybe most of the time we have a _pretty_ good idea of what the end
result should look like, but we don't have time to complete the entire feature.
We lost track of time, and we're missing a critical component.

It can be tempting to hunker down and try to complete everything we think
it should have, but is this really the best strategy? Instead, we should
take a look at the acceptance criteria of the feature–what is the _minimum_
amount of work needed to satisfy this criteria?

In the [Agile Manifesto][agilemanifesto], the tenth principle is this:
    
    Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
    of work not done--is essential.

I'm pretty sure this is referring to avoiding the smell of needless
complexity in our code, but it's something to think about when it comes to 
project features.

Why wouldn't we want to implement the rest of this feature? Well, the first
reason is that we just don't have time. It's either going to be missing 
altogether when meeting with the client, or it would have been coded under
immense pressure with no time for proof-reading and refactoring.

Another reason we'd want to stick to the "minimum amount of work" rule here
is that maybe, when you present the product, the client sees it and decides 
to go a _completely_ different direction. If you had decided to complete a 
week's worth of work in two days, it all would have been for nothing!

Save yourself the stress and the trouble–if it's not in the acceptance 
criteria, shelf it for later on in the project when you have some time to kill.
