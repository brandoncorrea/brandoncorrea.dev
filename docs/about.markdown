Hello! My name is Brandon Correa. The first thing you need to know about me
is that I love math, and take pride in acing Algebra while sleeping 
through class in high school. Now that that's out of the way, I also really 
enjoy coding and playing music. When I have free time, it is usually spent 
doing one of those two things.

I've recently started exploring different topics like chemistry and poetry.
I'm hoping that one day I'll be able to just run around in a lab coat doing 
crazy sciencey things, like Emmett Brown, and people will just think it's 
normal.

I don't really have anything else to say... so uh, yeah. Enjoy my blog!
